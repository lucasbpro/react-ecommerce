# react-ecommerce

This is my final project of AceleraDev React Online @Codenation. This is a sample of an e-commerce website which provides the following functionalities:

- It is *mobile-first* but also works in desktop;
- presents a catalog of products in the online store, which includes their description, price, available sizes and picture;
- allows user to select multiple products and add them to a shopping cart;
- allows user to search for a specific product.

The application is a SPA (*Single Page Application*) which relies on React.js and uses Redux for global state managing. There is a similar application running online [here](https://viniciusvinna.netlify.app/react-fashionista).

## How to run this project

Open this project directory in a terminal and install all the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```
Start the development server:

```shell
$ npm start
```
This application will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost/:3000).
