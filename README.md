This is my final project of AceleraDev React Online @[Codenation](https://www.codenation.dev/), which consists of a SPA (*Single Page Application*) implemented in React.js with the aid of Hooks and Redux design patterns. The app is a simple and functional e-commerce portal which provides:
- *mobile-first* design, but also works in desktop;
- a catalog of products in the online store, which includes their description, price, available sizes and picture;
- capability for adding multiple products to a shopping cart;
- capability for searching a specific product.

## How to run this locally

You need to have **[Node v13.8.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)** (or later) installed in your machine.

To run the project, open the project folder in a terminal and install all the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```
After dependencies installation, start the development server by typing:

```shell
$ npm start
```
The application will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost/:3000).
